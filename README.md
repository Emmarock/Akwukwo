# AKWUKWO

A mobile app for searching schools (primary and secondary) in Nigeria. 

## Problem Statement

Trying to find a good school for a child, most especialy in Nigeria is quite difficult, as you have to go to the schools one at a time to get information about the schools. You can also get the right school base on referral which can be really bad for some schools who do not have good referral system. This project is intended to serve both school owners and parents searching for schools for their child or wards. The goal here is to find the right school best fit for a  child.

## Overview of the application

This application is meant for school owners, proprietors, principals e.t.c, to register their schools by giving vital and valid information such as school's location, phone number, email, fees and so on. Users of the app can view the list of registered schools and also rate the school.
